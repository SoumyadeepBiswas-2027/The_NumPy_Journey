# 🧮 The NumPy Journey

Welcome to **The NumPy Journey**! This repository contains my hands-on exploration of NumPy — Python’s powerful library for numerical computing, especially useful for data science and machine learning.

## 📚 What's Covered

### ✅ Phase 1: NumPy Basics
- Introduction to NumPy arrays
- Array creation techniques
- Indexing and slicing
- Array attributes and data types
- Basic array operations

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Intermediate NumPy
- Array operations and broadcasting
- Sorting arrays
- Filtering with boolean masks
- `np.where()` vs Fancy Indexing
- Adding and removing elements
- Array compatibility and reshaping

---


### ✅ Phase 3: Advanced NumPy with Business Examples
- Vectorized string operations using `np.vectorize()`  
- Monthly average sales calculation  
- Zomato restaurant sales analysis using multi-dimensional arrays  
- Total sales per year using aggregation (`np.sum`)  
- Minimum sales per restaurant  
- Maximum sales per year  
- Average sales per restaurant  
- Cumulative sales using `np.cumsum`  
- Data visualization with Matplotlib (cumulative sales over years)  
- Vector arithmetic (addition, multiplication, dot product)  
- Calculating angle between two vectors using linear algebra
